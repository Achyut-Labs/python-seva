# Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:
Ordered List :-
1. **List** is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
2. **Tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
3. **Set** is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
4. **Dictionary** is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.


## List
```
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.<br>
Lists are created using square brackets<br>
List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.<br>
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.<br>
If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.<br>
**Mutable**, The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.<br>
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value - duplicate allowed,<br>
```
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
```
List items can be of any data type, A list can contain different data types,<br>
```
list = ["apple", True, 5]
```
From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list'<br>
```
<class 'list'>
```









## Tuple
## Set
## Dictionary
