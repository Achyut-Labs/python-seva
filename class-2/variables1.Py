# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
x = 5
y = "John"
# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes
z = 'Rudra'
# Case Sensitive
X = "Sally"
# You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

x = 5 

x = str(x)


print(x)

# is x turned into a string now
