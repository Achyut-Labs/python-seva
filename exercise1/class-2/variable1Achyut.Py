x = 5   # 5 is a integer
y = "John" # Jhon is a string

z = "Rudra" # is a single quoted string.  If you want you cam have double quoted quoration markes inside the string as the single qoted strings are used to string it.

X = "Sally" # Lower case x and upper case X are both di8fferent characters and they both support different things. Such as if you say x as the variable but put X it is False.


print(type(x)) # this will find what type of thing is it. Float, Integer and String
print(type(y))

x = str(3) # This will turn 3 into a string = "3"
y = float(3) # this will turn 3 into a float = 3.0
z = int(3)  # this will turn 3 into a intiger = 3
