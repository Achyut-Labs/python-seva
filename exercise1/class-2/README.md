What are variables:
Variables are like storage units for data and things like strings,integers,floats and sprites.A variable can be short like a character or a string of words. Variables can be used to represent what is stored in it like a word or sentence.

Functions using variables

 creating:A variable is made we you assign a value to a string or that data being stored
(E.g x=hello world)variables are made the second you assign a value to a piece of stored data.
Casting:
Casting is a function that allows you to specify the variable type. This is not required to be specified when you make a variable.e.g x = str(3) y = int(3) z = float(3) if printed the results will be x=3 y=3 z=3.0
Type:
The type function can be used to print what type your computer has classified  the variable. E.g x=1 y=”Hello world” if you use print(type(x))  and print(type(y)) you will get the result: <class ‘int’> and <class ‘str’>
