#list uses square brackets []
#Dictionary uses curly brackets {x:y}
#tuples uses brackets ()
#set uses curly brackets {1,2,5,'x'}

#immutable means it cannot be changed. Tuples are immutable 
#E.g x=(1,2,3,4)
#you can't add anything to this tuple. 

#A tuple, set, dictionary and list can be members of a tuple. 
#A member is what is inside the tuple.
